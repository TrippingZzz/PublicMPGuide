<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>By order of the Provost Marshal General</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>PART I: THE PARADE SQUARE</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Announce the training via :N. Do so a maximum of three times. If you do not have tempmod, ask a Brigadier General or above for it If there are less than three attendees, cancel the training. If there are three or more candidates then announce that the training is locked and those who wish to participate will have to ask your permission to do so. Also announce this via :N. Use !notepad to write down the start time and the starting attendance, as you will need this for the report.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inform the attendees that "PTS" is now in effect. Dismiss anyone who talks without your permission from now on.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start with face drills. The following are the face drills you are expected to take the attendees through (in no particular order):</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Left Face</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right Face</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">About Face</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Centre Face (NOT "Eyes Front")</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Left Half Face</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right Half Face</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not dismiss anyone who fails to do these correctly.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>IV. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Make all cadets to 20 JJ&rsquo;S and 20 Push ups.</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Move yourself to the end of the Parade Square and tell the attendees to form a SINGLE FILE LINE ("Column"). Once they have formed a column, you are to write down their names on !notepad. After you have done this, march the attendees to the education hall.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2><strong>PART II: THE EDUCATIONAL HALL</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Line the attendees at the vending machine at the Education Hall. Once you have done so, tell them to change into </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">their formal uniform with standard beret.</span></em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Once they have all changed into their formal attire, inform them of the rules of the Classroom, which are the following:</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must not enter the hall until I give you permission to do so</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you enter the Classroom, you must situate yourself in the &lsquo;Shoulder to Shoulder&rsquo; formation</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You must not yell in the Classroom.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Immediately dismiss anyone who fails to comply with these rules.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start allowing the attendees to enter the Classroom. Once they are all inside. Once they are in a suitable formation, inform them that you will be asking each and every one of them a question.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask each candidate a single question. The question can be anything. The purpose of these questions are to test their Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar (SPaG). If an attendee fails to display adequate SPaG then dismiss them from the training. Only those who communicated in clear and coherent English should still be in attendance.</span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now you are to lecture the attendees about the primary duty of the Military Police. Inform the attendees that they should use !notepad to jot down notes. Your lecture should include the following points:</span></li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Disclaimer: The word &lsquo;misdemeanor&rsquo; is, for some reason, filtered. As this is the case, you should use the word &lsquo;infraction&rsquo; or the term &lsquo;Minor Crimes&rsquo; instead.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Secondary Duty of the Military Police at Fort Carson is to enforce the law. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we see someone breaking the law, we take action; we issue the offender with warnings, depending upon their rank and the severity of the crime committed.</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What crimes are considered to be Felonies.</span></em></li>
<li>
<ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we see an Officer or a Senior Enlisted Non-Commissioned Officer (SSGT+) committing a felony, &nbsp;we report them immediately, we do NOT issue warnings to them. If we see anyone below the rank of SSGT commit a felony, we issue them with ONE warning. &nbsp;If they fail to heed our warning,we report them immediately then inform them that they have been reported and will be punished for their crimes</span></li>
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">What crimes are considered to be Misdemeanours.</span></em></li>
<li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we see an Officer or a Senior Enlisted Non-Commissioned Officer (SSGT+) committing a Misdemeanour, we issue them with ONE warning. If we see anyone below the rank of SSGT commiting a misdemeanour, we issue them with TWO warnings. If they fail to heed our warnings,we report them immediately then inform them that they have been reported and will be punished for their crimes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reports are filed in a channel in our Discord Server.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evidence is needed for a report to be valid. Evidence can either be a screenshot or a video recording. Evidence must also actually show the suspect committing the crime.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now move onto Scenarios. Tell the candidates that when you call their name, they are to come up. You are then to present them with a scenario of someone breaking the law in some way. Some examples of scenarios are:</span></li>
<li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A General Admin Abusing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Lieutenant driving recklessly</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Private First Class Walking on the grass.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Sergeant being insolent</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Corporal being immature.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are at liberty to choose whatever scenario you like.</span></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The attendees' answers should show that they've actually been paying attention to what you told them during the lecture. Dismiss anyone who fails to handle the scenario correctly.</span></li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Order the remaining attendees to leave the Education Hall and line up by the vending machines. Once they have done this, tell them to wear their combat attire then march them down to the Gate.</span></li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>PART III: THE GATE</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>IMPORTED DISCLAIMER: IF THERE ARE RAIDERS PRESENT, YOU ARE TO DO THIS PART IN THE CLASSROOM INSTEAD OF THE GATE</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you arrive at the Gate, make the attendees enter the &lsquo;STS&rsquo; formation. Once they have done so, you are to explain to them the following points. You are to tell them to use !notepad to write down notes, as they will be tested on this:</span></li>
<li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Primary Duty of the Military Police at Fort Carson is to defend the gate</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is to be at least 1 MP at the gate when there are 4 or more visitors</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All MPs are expected to report to the gate when there are raiders, the failure to do so results in harsh punishment</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The criteria for being considered KOS</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to clear visitors </span></li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are at liberty to explain more of our gatekeeping duties if you wish.</span></em></p>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have done this, quiz the attendees on what you have told them, to make sure that they have been listening to what you say. You are to ask each attendee at least 3 questions, if they fail to answer at least 2 questions correctly, then dismiss them.</span></li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">After this, you are to march the remaining attendees to the Pit.</span></li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>PART IV: THE PIT</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you arrived at the Pit. put your remaining attendees in STS formation.</span></li>
<li><br /><br /><br />
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell them that they have 5 mins to complete the pit. </span></li>
</ol>
<br /><br />
<p><strong>III. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once time is up, tp them to you and march them to the rally hall.</span></p>
<br /><br />
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">NOTE: NOT FINISHING THE PIT DOES NOT AFFECT THEIR ACCEPTANCE IN TO MP OR NOT. PEOPLE WHO HAVE GOT TO THE PIT HAVE PASSED</span></em></p>
<h2><strong>PART V: CONCLUSION</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have arrived to the rally hall, you are to inform the remaining attendees that the RT is over. You are then to inform the attendees to put their format uniform on. Tell them to enter the rally hall and not to sit unless they are told so.</span></li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell the graduates to &nbsp;salute. You then yourself will stand in front of them whilst in the "At-Ease" position. Take a screenshot for the training report. Once you have done so, order the graduates to return to the "Order Arms" position.</span></li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now tell the graduates to send a join request to the Military Police group. Then you are to tell them to join the Discord Server. You should give them an invite link by :naming yourself it. Once they've all joined the Discord Server, :unname yourself.</span></li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inform the graduates that they will be subject to a background check and that if they fail to meet the criteria, their join request will be denied. You are also to inform them that they </span></li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">have exactly 3 days to fully familiarise themselves with the Military Police Field Service Regulations.</span></li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dismiss the candidates, the training is now over.</span></li>
<li>
<h2><strong>PART VI: THE TRAINING REPORT</strong></h2>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly,do the background checks on the graduates. Only those who meet the following criteria can be accepted into the Military Police:</span></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you have done this, file the training report in the #training-reports channel on the Military Police Discord Server, using the following format:</span></li>
